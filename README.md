Application for Fintech module 

This web application was for a module I did in my second year at Temasek Polytechnic. 
It utilises a couple of APIs, Fidor sandbox account for transactional purposes, NewsAPI and Financial Modeling Prep to retrieve Financial News and the financial information for a stock and Firebase to simulate a trading portfolio.
